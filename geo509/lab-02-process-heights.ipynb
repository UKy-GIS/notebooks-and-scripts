    "# Creating colorized point clouds for bridges\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will create and colorize point clouds for three bridges in your study area and calculate their height above the stream. You will use these point clouds (and thier derivatives) to measure the physical properties of these bridges. If we find that the calculated bridge height is close to the measured height, we will use part of this analysis on all bridges.\n",

    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new ArcGIS Pro **Map** Project with a name that does not contain spaces.\n",
    "2. Verify your project name and that the project contains a geodatabase using the project name.\n",
    "3. Add you bridges layer you created in the first lab. Select three bridges; one bridge that was in the original data, one that you found and digitized, and one that you suspect is a typical private bridge. Export those three bridges to the geodatabase that was created in Step 1.\n",
    "4. Modify the cell below that sets the variables for your local environment. You should not need to modify any other cell.\n",
    "5. Run the remaining cells in order, top down. If you get errors, check your variables again. Rerun that cell and continue."
